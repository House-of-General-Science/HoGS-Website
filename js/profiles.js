When I'm not in class or working, you can usually find me hanging out on floor, drawing, or hiking when I can. Lastly, here is my biggest piece of advice to new members: \"Don't be afraid to get involved! There are so many opportunities and you can make so many amazing friends.\" I'm always here if you need me, so reach out! :)"
