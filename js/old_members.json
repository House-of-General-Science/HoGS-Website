(Try not to take the biblical suggestion too far, we're not claiming anything like that xD) I'm Skyler, I'm the one you will probably talk to the most. Wynn's the fun one, you'll probably hear from her most in the discord. Storm only shows up once in a while, but they're alright too.\nWe all hail from the Southern Tier of NY, and I'm one of the former tech heads. We're happy to help with most tech problems, and vocal supporters of Free and Open Source Software. I also play Tekken (buff Lars btw), and love talking fighting games or computer things in general. When [HUMAN MALWARE] isn't a thing, we're normally active on floor, and can often be found in either the discord or the social lounge. Feel free to say hi!"

I know everyone has said just how amazing HoGS is so I'm gonna change it up a bit. HoGS is a terrible place if you don't want to meet anyone, have no fun ever, and hate science. If that doesn't sound like you, join us in our quest to take over th.... Sorry not supposed to disclose that just yet... Join HoGS!!"
